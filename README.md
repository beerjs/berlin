# Welcome to beerjs Berlin

Use the [Issues Area](https://github.com/beerjs/berlin/issues) to make meetup suggestions, or simply to say 'Hi!'

We will also manage events with [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/beerjs-berlin) for those of you who aren't using or caring about GitHub (all three of you).
